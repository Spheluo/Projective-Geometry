homography estimation, forward and backward warping, marker-based planar AR, Panorama

## part 1. Homography Estimation
### Implements forward warping to warp images into canvas with part1.py
$ python3 part1.py

## part 2. Marker-Based Planar AR
### Familiar with off-the-shelf ArUco marker detection tool and practice backward warping with part2.py
$ python3 part2.py

## part 3. Unwarp the secret
### What can go wrong with practical homography?
$ python3 part3.py

## part 4. Panorama
### Practice panorama stitching with ORB feature detector, brute-force matching with ORB Descriptors, and RANSAC for selecting best homography.
$ python3 part4.py
